React =  A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
Next.js =  A flexible React framework for building blocks to create  web applications.

Use React to build your UI, then incrementally adopt Next.js features to solve common application requirements such as routing, data fetching.

DOM = An object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with parent and child relationships. 


 React is  Declarative UI Library

Imperative programming is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. 
Declarative programming is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. üçï

A popular declarative library that helps developers build user interfaces is React.

    Components= From JavaScript to React
Building UI with Components

User interfaces can be broken down into smaller building blocks called components.

Components allow you to build self-contained, reusable snippets of code. If you think of components as LEGO bricks, you can take these individual bricks and combine them together to form larger structures. If you need to update a piece of the UI, you can update the specific component or brick.

This modularity allows your code to be more maintainable as it grows because you can easily add, update, and delete components without touching the rest of our application.

The nice thing about React components is that they are just JavaScript. Let's see how you can write a React component, from a JavaScript perspective:
Creating components

In React, components are functions. Inside your script tag, write a function called header:

 

  component = A function that returns UI elements.
    Props
    State



Getting Started with Next.js
=============================== 
1.create a new file called package.json with an empty object {}.
2.run:     'npm install react react-dom next'  
3. Open  url =    https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/from-react-to-nextjs/getting-started-with-nextjs

4. Copy the code into the file 'index.js'
5. Move the index.js file to a new folder called pages.
6.  Add default export to your main React component to help Next.js distinguish which component to render as the main component of this page.

    export default function HomePage() {

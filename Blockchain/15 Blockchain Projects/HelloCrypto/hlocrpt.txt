                     Creating Our Own ERC20 Token
                     -----------------------------
1. Set up Truffle then truffle init
   
     npm install -g truffle  //Truffle is  Ethereum development framework , 
     truffle init   //initialize our project by  

     The new files and directories created in our project are Truffle's deployment
     scripts and config files.  
2. Install OpenZeppelin
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts //using the example token smart contract from OpenZeppelin. 
 
3. Open StandardToken.sol
 This is almost a copy of @openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol 
 which implements the IERC20.sol contract interface
 but instead of having private member variables we will leave them as public. 


5.  
truffle develop  //setup a local test blockchain by using Truffle 
    // The output is a list of Accounts and Private Keys

 
 6.  migrate //  Deploying the './contracts/SimpleToken.sol' contract  

    This will compile our smart contracts into JSON under the build folder,
    and also deploy the smart contracts unto the local blockchain.

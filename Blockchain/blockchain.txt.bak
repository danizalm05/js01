Blockchain: highly secure and reliable network that 
 records data in a distributed ledger that is not controlled by 
 a central authority.
 
 Smart contract:  a tamper-proof program that runs on a blockchain 
 network when certain predefined conditions are satisfied.
 
 Hybrid smart contracts: combine code running on the blockchain 
 (on-chain) with data and computation from outside the 
 blockchain (off-chain) provided by decentralized oracle networks.

blockchain oracle:  any device or entity that connects 
 a deterministic blockchain with off-chain data.
